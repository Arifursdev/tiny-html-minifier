            Some text
            with newlines
            and some spaces
        </textarea>

        <div class="test">
            <p>This text</p>
            <p>should not</p>
            <p>wrap on multiple lines</p>
        </div>
    </main>

            Some text
            with newlines
            and some spaces
        </textarea> <div class="test"> <p>This text</p> <p>should not</p> <p>wrap on multiple lines</p> </div> </main> </div> <script>
console.log('Newlines should be kept.');
console.log('Whitespace before and after each line should be gone.');
</script></body></html>
```

## Details

Instead of advanced regular expressions or a node solution, this minifier uses a "back to basic" approach. It explode the html elements into chunks. Different types of elements require different types of solutions.

### Head elements

No single spaces are kept in the head because there should not be any text there.

### Normal elements

Single spaces are kept to preserve inline elements and texts.

### Special elements like `textarea`, `code` and `pre`

These elements need to keep tabs, spaces and newlines intact. These elements will therefor not be minified at all.

### Comments `<!-- -->` and cdata `<![CDATA[]]>`

All html comments and cdata will be removed.

### Css `style`

Comments, double spaces, tabs and linebreaks are removed.

### Javascript `script`

It will keep the newlines, but it will trim the spaces at the start and end of each line.

## Pitfalls

If you put html tags inside a script tag, it may not be minified correctly. That's because the minifier is not aware of where elements starts and ends. To get around it, move that kind of javascript code into an external javascript file.
