## In short

- A PHP html minifier.
- Really really fast.
- Only 1 single file is required.
- This minifier uses a "back to basic" approach with almost no regular expressions.
- Inline `style` and `script` are minified very carefully.
- Elements like `textarea`, `code` and `pre` will not be minified, because they should not be.
- Comments and cdata will be removed
- No options needed.

## Install

### 1. Download the file

Download `tiny-html-minifier.php` or the whole ZIP.

### 2. Add the code

```
require 'tiny-html-minifier.php';
echo TinyMinify::html($html);
```

## Minification details

Instead of advanced regular expressions or a node solution, this minifier uses a "back to basic" approach. It explode the html elements into chunks. Different types of elements require different types of solutions.

### Normal elements

Single spaces are kept to preserve inline elements and texts.

### Head

No single spaces are kept in the head because there should not be any text there.

### Textarea, code and pre

These elements need to keep tabs, spaces and newlines intact. These elements will therefor not be minified at all.

### Html comments and cdata

All html comments and cdata will be removed.

### Style

Comments, double spaces, tabs and linebreaks are removed.

### Script

It will keep the newlines, but it will trim the spaces at the start and end of each line.

## Pitfalls

Because the class don't work with nodes, it does not know if it's inside a nested element or not, it will not crash if you forgot an ending tag somewhere. That's good, but the downside is that if you place html code inside an inline javascript, it may give you trouble.
