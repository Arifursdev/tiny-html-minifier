## Minification details

Instead of advanced regular expressions or a node solution, this minifier uses a "back to basic" approach. It explode html tags into chunks and depending on what type is it, it will minify it in a certain way.

### Normal html

Single spaces are kept to preserve inline elements and texts.

### Head

No single spaces are kept in the head elements as it should not be any text there.

### Textarea, code and pre

These elements need to keep tabs, spaces and newlines intact so these elements will not be minified at all.

### Html comments and cdata

All html comments and cdata will be removed.

### Style

Comments, double spaces, tabs and linebreaks are removed.

### Script

It will keep the newlines, but it will trim the spaces at the start and end of each line.

## Requirements

- PHP7+
